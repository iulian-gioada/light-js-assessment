# This is a light version of rmurphey's js-assessment

I adapted it to run it directly in browser without the necessity of npm and other node modules, thus easily used on computers without internet connection.
Be aware that the tests have the structure of the original ones but the test runner is not mocha. It's more of an experiment.

I made this for educative purposes, because the classroom doesn't have internet connection.
